# Blood Right

> A chapter of featherless' [digital creative history](https://github.com/featherless/digital-creative-history).

Blood Right began as a series of TI83+ video games and evolved over time into an epic RPG computer game concept.

Throughout high school we would organize weekly meetings to plan out the game's ideas, covering everything from
music to plot to the game engine.
