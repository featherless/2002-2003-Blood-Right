# Blood Right

> A chapter of featherless' [digital creative history](https://github.com/featherless/digital-creative-history).

Blood Right began as a series of TI83+ video games and evolved over time into an epic RPG computer game concept.

Throughout high school we would organize weekly meetings to plan out the game's ideas, covering everything from
music to plot to the game engine.

## Soundtrack

The soundtrack is available on Soundcloud:

## Engines

The game went through many game engine iterations, starting with a 2d engine and eventually moving to a very basic
custom 3d engine. The switch to the 3d engine ended up consuming so much time that the project stalled indefinitely.

## Concepts

### Mountain quest idea

    the mountains are devided into two regions
    upper and lower
    the lower half of the mountains is considered to be normal, because they are like the majority of the people in the world, like us
    but the lower half of the mountain is on offensive about the upper half of  the mountains, since it is colder up there
    and that is where my description of the snow mountain people come in
    the lower half of the mountain considers them freaks
    and wants them off the mountain
    but the upper half of the mountain is peacefull, and just wishes to stay out of the way
    so what you have to do is make them work together to do something
    and gradually get along better
    untill they are at peace
    then of course they give you something
